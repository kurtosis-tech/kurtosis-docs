Quickstart
==========

Prerequisites
-------------
* A [Kurtosis user account](https://www.kurtosistech.com/sign-up)
* A [Docker engine](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) with version >= 2.3.0.0

Bootstrap your testsuite
------------------------
1. Visit [the list of supported language clients](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/kurtosis-docs/blob/master/supported-languages.md)
1. Pick your favorite, and clone the repo to your local machine
1. Run the `bootstrap/bootstrap.sh` script from inside the cloned repo
1. Follow the language-specific instructions in the new `README.md` file

Run your testsuite
------------------
From the root directory of your bootstrapped repo: 

1. `git init` to initialize your new repo
1. `git add .` to stage all the files you've changed
1. `git commit -m "Init commit"` to commit the files (don't skip this - it's needed to run the testsuite!)
1. Run `scripts/build_and_run.sh all` to run the testsuite

If everything worked, you should see an output that looks something like this:

```
INFO[2020-10-15T18:43:27Z] ==================================================================================================
INFO[2020-10-15T18:43:27Z]                                      TEST RESULTS

INFO[2020-10-15T18:43:27Z] - fixedSizeExampleTest: PASSED
```

(This output is from the Kurtosis Go client; other languages might be slightly different)

If you don't see success messages, check out [the guide for debugging failed tests](./debugging-failed-tests.md) which contains solutions to common issues. If this still doesn't resolve your issue, you can ask for help in [the Kurtosis Discord server](https://discord.gg/6Jjp9c89z9).

Customize your testsuite
------------------------
Now that you have a running testsuite, you'll want to start customizing the testsuite to your needs. Here we'll walk through the components inside a testsuite, as well as how to customize them.

**NOTE:** Kurtosis testsuites can be written in any language. This tutorial will avoid language-specific idioms and use a Java-like pseudocode notation in this documentation, but will reference the example in [the Go implementation](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/kurtosis-go) to illustrate. All object names and methods will be more or less the same in your language of choice, and [all language repos](./supported-languages.md) come with an example.

### Service Interface & Implementation
You're writing a Kurtosis testsuite because you want to write tests for a network, and networks are composed of services. To a test, a service is just an API that represents an interaction with the actual Docker container. To give your tests this API, define an implementation of the `Service` interface that provides the functionality you want for your test [like this](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/kurtosis-go/blob/develop/testsuite/services_impl/nginx_service.go). Here you'll provide the functions you want to be able to call on the service, as well as two Kurtosis-required bits:

1. `Service.getIpAddress`, a getter to retrieve the service's IP and a check if the service is available. Your service should take in the IP address as a constructor parameter, and return it with this function; later we'll see how this gets passed to the constructor.
2. `Service.isAvailable`, a check you'll need to implement to tell Kurtosis when your service should be considered available and ready for use.

By now, you should have an implementation of the `Service` interface that represents an instance of your service.

### Docker Container Initializer
Our tests now have a nice interface for interacting with a service running in a Docker container, but we need to tell Kurtosis how to actually start the Docker container running the service. This is done by implementing the `DockerContainerInitializer` interface. This interface will be very well-documented in code in your language, so you can use the documents there to write an initializer [like this](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/kurtosis-go/blob/develop/testsuite/services_impl/nginx_container_initializer.go). Of note: this is where you'll pass in the IP address to the constructor of your `Service` implementation.

### Tests & Test Setup
Now that we have a service, we can use it in a test. Each test is simply an implementation of the `Test` interface, and each has a `Test.setup` method which performs the work necessary to setup the testnet to a state where the test can run over it. You should use the `NetworkContext.addService` method to create instances of your service [like this](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/kurtosis-go/blob/9b27afdcf6e065fc05c15990b1723cf7d2338449/testsuite/testsuite_impl/fixed_size_nginx_test_.go#L34). 

The `addService` call return an instance of your service, as well as an `AvailabilityChecker` object. The `waitForStartup` method of the checker is a polling wrapper around `Service.isAvailable` that you wrote earlier, and can be used to block until the service instance is up or a timeout is hit.

Finally, the `Test.setup` method must return a `Network` object. This returned object will be the same one passed in as an argument to the `Test.run` method, which the test can use to interact with the network. For now, you can return the `NetworkContext` object.

### Test Logic
Every implementation of the `Test` interface must fill out the `Test.run` method. This function takes in the `Network` object that was returned by `Test.setup`, and uses the methods on the `TestContext` object to make assertions about the state of the network [like so](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/kurtosis-go/blob/9b27afdcf6e065fc05c15990b1723cf7d2338449/testsuite/testsuite_impl/fixed_size_nginx_test_.go#L56). If no failures are called using the `TestContext`, the test is assumed to pass.

### Custom Networks
So far you've your `Test.setup` method has returned the Kurtosis-provided `NetworkContext`, and your `Test.run` method has consumed it. This can be enough for basic tests, but you'll often want to create a custom object [like this](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/kurtosis-go/blob/9b27afdcf6e065fc05c15990b1723cf7d2338449/testsuite/networks_impl/single_node_nginx_network/dynamic_single_node_nginx_network.go#L26) to represent your networks as your testsuite gets more complex. To this end, Kurtosis allows your `Test.setup` method to return whatever type you please using the `Network` marker interface, and use that same object in the `Test.run` method. This promotes code reuse across your tests, so that each test doesn't have copy-pasted setup methods.

### Test Suite
Now that you have a test, your last step is to package it into a testsuite. A testsuite is simply an implementation of the `TestSuite` interface that yields a set of named tests, [like this](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/kurtosis-go/blob/develop/testsuite/testsuite_impl/testsuite.go). This is also where you'll thread through parameterization, like what Docker image the tests should run with.

### Main Function
With your testsuite complete, your only remaining step is to make sure it's getting used. When you bootstrapped your testsuite repo, you will have received an entrypoint main function that receives several flags, instantiates a testsuite, and passes that to the Kurtosis client [like this Go example](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/kurtosis-go/blob/develop/testsuite/main.go). You will also have received a Dockerfile, for packaging that main CLI into a Docker image ([Go example](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/kurtosis-go/blob/develop/testsuite/Dockerfile)). What `build_and_run.sh` actually does during its "build" phase is compile the main entrypoint CLI and package it into an executable Docker image. In order for your testsuite to get run, you just need to make sure the main entrypoint CLI is using your testsuite.

You now have a custom testsuite running using Kurtosis!

### Custom Parameterization
You'll notice that one of the flags that the example entrypoint CLI above receives is `serviceImageArg`, which defines the name of the Docker image to use in the services in the network. This a **custom parameter** - a parameter not used by Kurtosis itself but by the testsuite. Your testsuite might also need additional parameters. To pipe these through, you'll need to:

1. Add another flag to the main CLI and pass it to your `TestSuite` object's constructor
1. Modify the Dockerfile to set the flag value using an environment variable

These environment variables in the Dockerfile might seem like magic, but they're just set by Kurtosis when it launches the Docker image containing your testsuite. You'll need to tell Kurtosis what values to use for your custom flags, which can be done at time of launch with the `CUSTOM_ENV_VARS_JSON` parameter to the Kurtosis initializer. For example, if your Dockerfile uses the `MY_CUSTOM_VAR` environment variable then you might call `build_and_run.sh` with `--env CUSTOM_ENV_VARS_JSON="{\"MY_CUSTOM_ENV_VAR\":5}"`.
